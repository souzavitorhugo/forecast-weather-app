# Forecast Weather App

This project is about learning and improving front-end skills, such as HTML, CSS and JS with ReactJS and it's libraries.

## Technologies

Used the free API from https://openweathermap.org/current to do the researches.

Beyond frontend basis, the project was initialy build with:

- ReactJS;
- Create-React-App;
- Native JS Geolocation API; 

Used libraries like: 
- Formik, to validate forms;
- Yup, to validate objects;
- React Router, to create and manipulate routes;

## Versions

It was thought in version types, first the simple mode, were the user could:

- Allow the system to read his current position, and show the weather at the exact moment.
- If the geolocation was not allowed, the user can provide a city name, and receive the same information
- User is allowed to browse the pages normally, regardless the initiation type.

In the upcomming versions will probably be added long days previsions, layout improvements, a litlle backend to get all the errors and data manipulation separeted from the front-end. And even far away, maybe a trully app, built with React Native.

The usage of the API is free, until certain point. With the FREE KEY, you can access current data and the 3-hour forecast 5 days long only, with the 60 calls/minute ou 1,000,000 calls/month max.
